git pull is used when you want to make changes when there is another one making changes too (my understanding not sure)               
=======
               
The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows
